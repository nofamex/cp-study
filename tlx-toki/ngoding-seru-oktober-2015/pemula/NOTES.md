understand more of the utility on the languange you are using for program, in this case python3, search for utility use such as mapping, iterating and converting types.

read the question carefully, pay attention to every detail in input and output, a simple mispell will lead to WA. ALWAYS READ THE QUESTION MORE THAN ONCE!.

when dealing with low scope question (eg. sorting with finite element) try mapping it to existing harder question but don't overthink, just lower your scope of thinking to the given question.

when your brute force fail, try breaking it one by one.

remember math concept.
